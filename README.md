# Gander

> *Take a gander at your agents.* A NOC for everything your Claude Code agents are doing.

<p align="center"><img src="web/public/logo.png" width="600" alt="The Gander NOC — a goose manager overseeing a floor of AI agents" /></p>

A live, animated dashboard of your **Claude Code agents and sub-agents** — a Hollywood-Squares / Zoom-style grid where each agent is a pixel-art avatar that physically acts out what it's doing: thinking, reading, coding, spawning sub-agents, running tests, erroring, idling. Parent and child agents are linked with curved connectors carrying **animated packets that flow downward** to show information moving through the hierarchy.

It attaches to any project automatically via Claude Code **hooks** — no manual wiring once installed.

## What you get

- **Live agent tiles** — one per session/sub-agent, driven by real tool activity.
- **Persistent Orchestrator root** — the main session is always present (idle when quiet) as the root of the tree.
- **Recursive hierarchy view** — connectors from each agent to its sub-agents at any depth, with subtree hover-highlight and animated parent→child flow.
- **Office floor + Mosaic views** — a top-down animated office where agents walk, gather at the water cooler, and route packets to their sub-agents; or a compact responsive tile grid.
- **3 avatar tiers** — pixel art (procedural Canvas), abstract (waveforms/EQ/rings), and top-down desk people / your own images.
- **Click any agent** — a modal to read its current task, reply, stop it, **focus its window** (raise the live terminal it's running in), or open its folder / VS Code.
- **Per-session analytics** — each agent's modal shows efficiency gauges parsed from its transcript: **cache-hit %** (context reused vs re-sent), **output-cost share** (verbose answers vs context bulk), and a **context-window bar** that fills amber→red toward the model limit. When a parked session is near full, a **Compact now** nudge types `/compact` for you — freeing context and the cache-read you'd pay on every later turn.
- **Live cost + runaway alerts** — each agent tile shows its session spend, and any agent burning money fast (a stuck/looping session) lights up red with a `💸 $/min` badge so you can catch it and stop it before it runs up a bill. Toggle off in Settings if you don't care about spend.

## Control center — manage Claude Code, not just watch it

Beyond visualization, Gander is a local control panel for everything Claude Code on your machine (top-bar buttons):

- **Projects** — the one place for everything per-project. Every Claude project (running, recently active, or discovered from folders you add — typed or via a native picker) shows the components it uses: skills, agents, commands. Copy any component between projects (or to/from your global `~/.claude`, with an overwrite confirm); see per-project **git status** (branch · dirty · ahead/behind); **▶ Start** a session, **Pull**, or **Commit & Push** in place. **Expand a project** to also manage its **hooks** (view + delete), **MCP servers** (add from a preset / remove), and raw **`settings.json`** — right where the project lives.
- **Usage** — token & cost analytics parsed from your `~/.claude` transcripts (including sub-agent sessions): total spend, 30-day chart, per-project / per-model breakdowns, priciest sessions. Today's + total spend also show live in the status bar.
- **GitHub** — open PRs and issues per project via the `gh` CLI, click to open in the browser.
- **Routines & briefings** — save reusable prompts that call your skills/MCP (e.g. a *Morning Brief* that checks mail, calendar & news), **Run now** or **schedule** them daily at a set time. They run **headlessly** (`claude -p`) and their output lands on the dashboard as a **briefing** — a fresh one greets you with a card and can ping Telegram/desktop. "What did I miss overnight?", answered.
- **History** — recent sessions across all projects with their first prompt; **▶ Resume** any one (`claude --resume <id>` in a terminal) or copy the command.
- **Processes** — the long-running / port-holding processes your sessions spawned and **left open** — a dev server still on `:3000`, a stray `node`/`python`. Gander can't see these from hooks (the tool call returns while the process keeps living), so it scans the OS, attributes each to the session whose window spawned it (orphans grouped apart), and gives you a one-click **Kill** (force-kills the tree). Each agent's modal also lists what *that* session left running. *(Windows-first.)*
- **Telegram** — get pinged when a session is waiting on you, and reply or `/stop` from your phone.
- **＋ New task** — a top-bar button (and `/`-palette entry): type a goal, pick a project, and it opens a new Claude session working on it.
- **Bundled skills + agents** — install ships two into your `~/.claude`: **`component-builder`** (scaffold a new agent / skill / slash command from plain English) and **`context-audit`** (find what a project re-sends *every turn* — CLAUDE.md, MCP tool schemas, listed skills, memory — ranked by token cost, with a trim plan and a leaner CLAUDE.md rewrite). Just ask Claude *"why is this session so expensive?"* or *"audit my context / trim my CLAUDE.md"* — it reads the live cache-hit / context-fill gauges above and tells you exactly what to cut.

> **Note:** **▶ Start** / **＋ New task** open a *fresh terminal* session, so Claude Code shows its one-time **"trust this folder"** prompt for that project — choose **"1. Yes, I trust this folder"** to continue. You normally don't see this when opening from VS Code because the folder is already trusted there.

## Install

**Requirements:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and Claude Code.

### One-step setup (recommended)

Clone the repo, then from the Gander folder run the setup script for your OS:

```bash
# Windows
setup.bat                  # global: every Claude session on this machine reports in
setup.bat --project        # only sessions started in this folder

# macOS / Linux
./setup.sh                 # global   (use --project to scope to this folder)
```

It checks for Node, wires Gander's hooks into your Claude Code `settings.json` (without touching your other settings), and prints the next steps. The dashboard is **prebuilt** (`dashboard/dist`) — nothing to compile just to run it.

Prefer to do it by hand? The setup scripts just call the installer:

```bash
node install.js            # global   (or: node install.js --project)
```

Then, in any open session run `/hooks` (or restart) to load the hooks. To remove everything:

```bash
node uninstall.js          # or: node uninstall.js --project
```

### Optional setup

These are app-wide settings, configured from the dashboard's **⚙ Settings → App configuration** drawer (saved to `bridge/aoc-config.json`). *(Per-project hooks/MCP/`settings.json` live in **Manage → Projects** instead — expand a project.)*

- **Telegram** — paste a bot token + your chat id to get pinged when a session needs you, and reply or `/stop` from your phone.
- **Cost budget** — a daily / per-session spend cap that alerts via banner + Telegram.
- **Open-in-editor command** — only if "Open in VS Code" can't auto-detect your editor; point it at `code.cmd`, `codium`, etc.
- **Idle nudge** — wake parked sessions so a queued reply delivers immediately. **The bridge runs this itself — no Windows scheduled task or cron needed.** In **Settings → App configuration → Wake idle sessions**, turn on **Wake on send** (fires the moment you reply) and/or set a **nudge interval** in minutes (0 = off). It finds each idle session's window (VS Code or terminal) by PID and types a wake — keep the Claude terminal focused in each window.

### Develop / rebuild the dashboard

Only needed if you change the UI (`web/src`):

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run build   # outputs to dashboard/dist (what the bridge serves)
cd web && npm run dev                    # hot-reload dev server
```

### Alternative: as a Claude Code plugin

```
/plugin marketplace add <this-repo-or-path>
/plugin install gander@gander
```

Either way, on your next session the `SessionStart` hook starts the bridge and opens the dashboard at `http://localhost:3131/`. As Claude works, tiles light up automatically — and you can **send messages or stop** any session right from its tile.

### How the automatic wiring works

| Hook | Effect on the dashboard |
|------|-------------------------|
| `SessionStart` | Launches the bridge (`bridge/launch.js`) and opens the dashboard once |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Orchestrator → thinking |
| `PostToolUse` | Maps the tool to a state (Read/Glob→reading, Write/Edit→coding, Bash→coding/testing, Task→spawning, …) |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | → error |
| `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` | Creates a child tile (spawning) / marks it done |
| `Stop` / `SessionEnd` | Orchestrator → idle |

All event hooks are `type: "http"` posting to `http://localhost:3131/api/hook`, which maps the raw payload to agent updates — cross-platform, no scripts.

## Manual control

Use the `/agent-ops` skill, or:

```bash
node bridge/launch.js                      # start bridge + open dashboard (idempotent)
curl -s http://localhost:3131/api/state    # status
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3131/api/reset   # clear tiles
```

### Drive it from a headless run (no plugin/hooks)

```bash
claude -p "task" --output-format stream-json --verbose | node bridge/server.js --stdin
# or let the server spawn the run itself:
node bridge/server.js --run "claude -p 'task' --output-format stream-json --verbose"
```

## Architecture

```
.claude-plugin/
  plugin.json          # plugin manifest
  marketplace.json     # distribution manifest
hooks/
  hooks.json           # SessionStart launches the bridge; tool/Stop/Notification → emit.js
  emit.js              # forwards hook payloads to the bridge (+ command return channel, last-message capture)
bridge/
  server.js            # zero-dep HTTP server: serves the dashboard + the event/command/inspect API
  parser.js            # stream-json → agent events (for the --stdin / --run pipeline)
  launch.js            # cross-platform idempotent launcher
  license.js           # optional Gumroad license verification
  projects.js          # project registry: discover projects + components, copy between them
  git.js               # per-project git status (branch/dirty/ahead/behind)
  usage.js             # token/cost analytics from ~/.claude transcripts
  github.js            # PRs/issues via the gh CLI
  configmgr.js         # read/delete hooks + MCP servers in a project
  history.js           # recent resumable sessions
web/                   # Svelte 5 + Vite dashboard SOURCE
  src/App.svelte, src/lib/*.svelte, src/lib/*.js
  src/lib/{ProjectsSidebar,CostPanel,GithubPanel,SettingsPanel,HistoryPanel}.svelte  # control-center panels
  -> `npm run build` outputs to dashboard/dist (what the bridge serves)
dashboard/dist/        # built dashboard (shipped)
skills/
  agent-ops/SKILL.md   # manual control skill
install.js, uninstall.js   # merge/remove the hooks in settings.json
```

The bridge + hooks stay small, readable Node (they run on every tool call on the user's machine); the dashboard is a compiled Svelte app. Rebuild the UI with `cd web && npm run build` (or `npm run dev` for hot-reload).

```

States: `idle · thinking · coding · spawning · reading · testing · error · done · awaiting`.

## Configuration

`bridge/aoc-config.json` (gitignored) or env vars:

- **Port** — `AOC_PORT` (default `3131`).
- **Telegram alerts/replies** — `{ "telegramToken": "...", "telegramChatId": "...", "dashboardUrl": "..." }` (or `AOC_TG_TOKEN` / `AOC_TG_CHAT` / `AOC_DASH_URL`). For inbound replies, the bot must have no webhook — use a dedicated bot via `"telegramReplyToken"` if needed.
- **Avatar images** — imported from the dashboard (**Images…** / **Action images…**), stored in the browser's localStorage.
- **Runaway burn threshold** — `{ "burnAlert": 5.0 }` ($/min, default `5.0`). An active session gets the red "runaway" highlight only when its smoothed spend stays above this for two samples in a row (so a single big turn doesn't trip it). The visual can be toggled per-browser in Settings → *Cost & burn alerts*. Note: spend is *estimated* from token counts at API list prices.
- **Model pricing** — `{ "pricing": { "deepseek": { "input": 0.27, "output": 1.10 } } }`. Gander prices Claude models (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku/Fable) at Anthropic list rates out of the box. Keys here match as **case-insensitive substrings** of the model id and override those rates, so a non-Anthropic or local backend (see *other models* below) is costed correctly. `input`/`output` are USD per million tokens; `cacheWrite`/`cacheRead` default to 1.25× / 0.1× input if omitted. Any model that matches neither the built-ins nor your overrides is treated as **free** ($0) rather than charged Claude rates.
- **New session options** (Settings → *App configuration* → *New session options*, applied to **▶ Start** and **＋ New task**):
  - **Claude command / path** — `{ "claudeCmd": "" }`. Runs `claude` on PATH by default; if you get *"'claude' is not recognized"*, set the full path (`where claude` / `which claude`, e.g. `C:\Users\you\.local\bin\claude.exe`).
  - **Permission mode** — `{ "launchPermMode": "" }`: `""` (ask, default) · `acceptEdits` · `plan` · `bypass`. **`bypass`** launches with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` so Claude won't prompt before edits/commands — handy if you don't want to babysit prompts, but only use it on projects you trust. *(The one-time "trust this folder" prompt has no bypass flag, but Claude remembers it per folder after you accept once.)*
  - **Extra flags** — `{ "launchFlags": "" }`: appended verbatim, e.g. `--model sonnet`.

## Using other models (claude-code-router)

Gander watches **Claude Code**, not a specific model — so it works unchanged when you route Claude Code to other backends (DeepSeek, Gemini, OpenRouter, a local Ollama model…) with [claude-code-router](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router). The router only changes *where* Claude Code sends requests (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`); the hooks still fire and the transcript is still written, so every session and sub-agent shows up the same.

- **Watch routed sessions** — nothing to do. Run `ccr code` (or set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and use `claude`) and they appear on the dashboard.
- **Launch routed sessions from Gander** — either set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456` in your environment (so **▶ Start** / **＋ New task** route automatically), or point the **claude command** (Settings → *App configuration* → *New session options*) at the router.
- **Keep cost honest** — add the provider's rates under **`pricing`** (above). Without it, a non-Claude model is treated as **free** rather than charged Claude prices, so the cost panel won't lie either way.

## FAQ

(Also in the dashboard under the **?** button.)

- **I closed the dashboard tab / how do I know it's even running, and how do I get back?** The dashboard opens **once**, automatically, when the bridge first starts (SessionStart). The bridge then keeps running in the background — it survives closing the browser *and* restarting your editor — so a later session sees it's already up and **won't** pop a new tab. To get back, you have three options: (1) type **`/gander`** in any session — it checks the bridge and reopens the dashboard; (2) just ask Claude to "open the Gander dashboard"; (3) go to the fixed URL — **http://localhost:3131** (only different if you set `AOC_PORT`). Once it's open, **Manage → Health** confirms uptime and that hooks are wired.
- **A session says "waiting on you" but I can't see the options it's asking.** Claude Code draws numbered prompts (plan approval, menus) in the **terminal TUI** — it doesn't send the option text through hooks or the transcript, so Gander **can't display them**. Open the session (**Open in VS Code**) to read the menu, then answer remotely with the **⌨ quick-keys** in the agent modal (`1`/`2`/`3` · `↑`/`↓` · `↵` · `y`/`n` · `Esc`). *Permission* prompts are the exception — their reason ("needs permission to use Bash") **is** shown.
- **Can I answer prompts from the dashboard?** Yes — the **⌨ quick-keys** type a keystroke into the session's window. Gander finds it either by the **PID it captured at launch** (▶ Start / ＋ New task remember the window) or by **project name in the title** (VS Code shows the folder). A session you opened **manually outside Gander** in a bare terminal may not be reachable — Claude renames the terminal to "Claude Code", so there's no project name to match and no captured PID. The flash tells you honestly if the window wasn't found. It steals focus and types into whatever's focused there, so keep the **Claude terminal focused** in that window.
- **"'claude' is not recognized" when I ▶ Start.** Your `claude` CLI isn't on PATH — set its full path in **Settings → App configuration → New session options** (`where claude` / `which claude`).
- **"Trust this folder?" appears on Start / New task.** Launching opens a fresh terminal, so Claude shows its one-time, per-folder **trust prompt** — choose *Yes*. It's remembered after the first accept (you skip it from VS Code because the folder's already trusted there).
- **A sub-agent shows no cost.** Cost is per **session** (one transcript); a sub-agent's spend rolls up into its parent session, so only the session (root) carries the figure.
- **Why "$X/min" / why so high?** Spend is **estimated** from token counts at API list prices — on a Max/subscription plan you aren't literally paying that; treat it as a relative "spending fast" signal.
- **Replies aren't instant.** They're queued and delivered when the session next runs a turn; enable **Settings → App configuration → Wake idle sessions** to nudge a parked session so it picks up your reply right away.
- **My scheduled routine's email/calendar didn't work.** Routines run **headlessly** (`claude -p`), and **interactively-authenticated MCP servers** (e.g. the claude.ai Gmail/Calendar connectors) often **aren't available unattended** — they need an interactive login the headless run can't do. Skills and token-based/local MCP servers work fine. Test a routine with **Run now** first to see what's available before relying on a schedule. Also: routines run with the permission mode you pick (default **skip all prompts**, since nothing's there to answer them) — keep briefing routines **read-only**.

## Platform support & contributing

Gander is developed and exercised daily on **Windows**. The dashboard, bridge, and all the data features (projects, usage, GitHub, history, routines/briefings) are plain Node + browser and should work anywhere. The **OS-specific surface is the window automation** — launching sessions and typing into them:

| What | Windows | macOS | Linux |
|------|---------|-------|-------|
| Launch a session (▶ Start / ＋ New task) | `cmd` + captured window PID | `osascript` (Terminal) | `x-terminal-emulator` |
| Idle nudge / ⌨ quick-keys (type into a session window) | WScript + PID/title | `osascript` keystrokes | `xdotool` |
| Open folder / editor | ✓ | `open` | `xdg-open` |
| Audio (TTS + voice input) | browser Web Speech | browser Web Speech | browser Web Speech |

**On macOS or Linux? Please give it a spin and open issues/PRs** — that's the fastest way to make it solid everywhere. The window-automation scripts (`scripts/nudge-idle.sh`, `scripts/sendkeys.sh`) and the launch/open paths in `bridge/server.js` are the most likely places to need a tweak. Bug reports, "it didn't work on my distro" notes, and PRs are all welcome. 🙏
