Open the session (Open in VS Code) to read the menu, then answer remotely with the ⌨ quick-keys. Permission prompts DO show their reason (e.g. “needs permission to use Bash”).'],
        ['Answering prompts (⌨ quick-keys)', 'The ⌨ row in an agent’s modal types a keystroke into that session’s window (1/2/3 · ↑/↓ · ↵ · y/n · Esc). Hivemind finds the window by the PID it captured at launch (▶ Start / ＋ New task) or by project name in the title (VS Code). A session you opened manually in a bare terminal (titled “Claude Code”) may not be reachable — the flash says so. It steals focus and types into whatever’s focused there, so keep the Claude terminal focused.'],

        ['Skip permission prompts', 'Settings → New session options → “skip ALL prompts” launches with --dangerously-skip-permissions, so Claude won’t ask before edits/commands. Only use it on projects you trust.'],
